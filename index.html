										<h1>What is Grapel</h1>
										<p>
											Grapel is a system in which gamer's scores are registered. The purpose of Grapel is not only to register the score but people can also get something from this system such as money, ticket, gift card, etc.

									<h1>Why Grapel</h1>
									<h2>Please imagine that Professional Gamer is common in the world!</h2>
									<p>
										Usually, a lot of children have dreams such as becoming a professional athlete, lawyer, president, etc. But most children donâ€™t have dreams to become a Professional Gamer even though there are many children who are interested in games. Why is it? We think it is because this job is not common. Nevertheless, Grapel is going to be the platform for children who indulge themselves into games. It will provide them a world, allow their dreams to happen and become Professional gamers.

									<h1>Feature</h1>
									<h2>Grapel is very simple but very powerful!</h2>
									<p>
										Grapel gathers the score from each game and creates the ranking table. But the most important function is the return. Grapel returns something (such as money, ticket card etc) to the player who ranks at the top. And Grapel is a cloud system, so almost every game can connect to this system if ever they need it.

									<h1>how to use</h1>
									<h2>Start by creating an account.</h2>
									<p>
										At first, you create an account in Grapel by clicking on the link below. When you play the game during the campaign, the score you get is registered into Grapel automatically. But you only get to play games that are included in the campaign. Games in the campaign vary every time. Please check the current campaign games below.

									<h1>request</h1>
									<p>
										We are handling this as a personal project. Therefore we don't have enough money to give to the player. We think the return is the most important part of this system based on the concept.
									</p>
									<p>
										So we are asking you to help us by donating to the token. We promise to use all of your donations to return them to the player.
