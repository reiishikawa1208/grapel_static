										<h1>What is Grapel</h1>

									<h1>Why Grapel</h1>
									<h2>Please imagine what if the professional gamer is common in the world.</h2>
									<p>
										Usually, a lot of children have the dream such as being a football player, lawyer, president and etc. But almost children donâ€™t have the dream to become a professional gamer even though there are many children who like the game. Why is it? I think this is because that job is not common. Grapel is going to be the platform for a professional gamer and make the world in which children who like the game have the dream as a professional gamer.

									<h1>Feature</h1>
									<h2>Grapel is very simple but very powerful.</h2>
									<p>
										Grapel gathers the score from each game and creates the ranking table. But the most important function is the return. Grapel return something (such as money, ticket card and etc) back to the player who ranks in the top. And Grapel is a cloud system, so almost the game can connect to this system if they need it.

									<h1>how to use</h1>
									<h2>Preparation is only creating an account.</h2>
									<p>
										At first, you create the account for Grapel in the following link, and then you only play the game which is against the campaign. When you play the game during the campaign, the score you played is registered into Grapel automatically. The campaign game is different each time. Please check the current campaign game in the following site.

									<h1>request</h1>
									<p>
										We are handling this project as a personal project. Therefore we can not prepare enough money to return for the player. We think the return is the most important for this system because the return is based on the concept.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you can help us, please dominate the following token. We promise to use all of that domination to return for the player.
